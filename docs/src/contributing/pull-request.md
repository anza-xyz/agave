# The PR process for agave source code development

## Preparation

1. You’ll need a powerful machine for this task. Building Agave from source requires a significant amount of RAM—aim for at least 30GB to ensure sufficient memory.
   1. Rust-analyzer is capable of running on the Agave source tree but expect high memory consumption
2. Make a fork of `anza-xyz/agave` master branch under your own namespace in github. Let us assume it is called `ubercoder/agave`
   1. Do not ever commit anything into the master branch of your fork. Keep your branch synced with the upstream; this will make the rebase process much smoother.
   2. Whenever you want to pull agave code, pull it from your fork not from the agave repo directly.
3. Follow a guide to set up a reasonable rust development environment, e.g. [this one](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/?tab=readme-ov-file#building)
   1. Make sure you can build the code before proceeding
4. Plan the minimal viable set of changes needed to achieve your goals. Idea is to keep your PRs as small and simple as feasible.


## When not to file a PR

1. Your code/comments may expose/highlight a security threat in the existing deployed instances. In such cases please follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/blob/master/SECURITY.md).


## Procedure

1. Make a feature branch on `ubercoder/agave` repo, e.g. `fix_all_bugs`
2. Pull `master` and `fix_all_bugs` branches from `ubercoder/agave`
3. Make any necessary changes to `fix_all_bugs`
   1. Commit and push as appropriate, make sure your commits are sensibly sized
4. To keep track of changes in upstream `anza-xyz/agave`:
   1. Sync the `ubercoder/agave` master branch with upstream. You can do this with cli or github. **This should always fast-forward** since you are never committing anything to `ubercoder/agave` master.
   2. Pull the latest version of `ubercoder/agave` master to your local machine if you have updated your fork via github
   3. Checkout the `fix_all_bugs` branch and rebase it onto master's head (`git rebase master`). This rebase will pull in the changes made in the upstream’s master branch into your `fix_all_bugs` branch. Fix conflicts if necessary. Follow applicable rebase guides.
   4. Now you can force-push the `fix_all_bugs ` branch to rewrite its history on the git server (necessary due to rebase)
5. Make sure you run this procedure before every commit that you intend to push for review:
   1. Make sure your code builds without warnings - `./cargo build` is a good start
   2. Run tests on all packages you have worked on ``` ./cargo test \--package \<crate\_name\> ```
      1. Just running `./cargo test` in the root directory will run so many tests that it will probably take a while, and some tests might flake (e.g. due to port/address reuse), so only run the tests on the crates you touch (and crates that use your code).
   3. If your crate has examples, they should get built by `cargo test`, but they will not get run. Make sure they work correctly, CI will not hold your hand here.
   4. ```./scripts/cargo-fmt.sh && ./scripts/cargo-clippy.sh``` will make sure all your rust code is formatted and linted. Cargo-clippy will also implicitly check that the code compiles.
   5. Make sure your `Cargo.toml` files are *perfect* [by sorting them](#unsorted-deps)
   6. Make sure there are no trailing whitespaces anywhere `git diff origin/master --check --oneline`
      1. If you find any trailing whitespaces that `cargo fmt` will not fix, you can use e.g. `sed  's/[ \t]*$//'` to fix them manually
   7. You can manually run an approximation of full github CI with ``` ./ci/run-local.sh``` to diagnose any problems
   8. Once all of the above checks pass, make the final commit and push `fix_all_bugs` branch to github
      1. Make sure you [squash unnecessary commits](#pr-squash-commits) to ensure your commit log is sensible
6. To create a PR:
   1. Go to `ubercoder/agave` on github, switch to `fix_all_bugs` branch, and make PR against `anza-xyz/agave` master
   2. Make sure you explain exactly why this PR is needed
   3. If you expect to follow with more PRs to expand on a feature, make it clear
7. If you are not an agave core developer, your PR will be reviewed by one. If your PR gets gets approved, the CI process will be enabled for it.
   1. If you are an agave core developer, consider choosing “make draft PR” option so your PR does not pollute the PR list before you are sure that CI checks pass
8. Wait for github to run CI, this will take about 1 hour. Make sure CI passes, and your PR will be ready for final review
   1. Find some 2-3 nice reviewers to go over your code. If you do not know who to choose as a reviewer, ask around on discord.
   2. Remeber, reviewers are humans and have feelings too.
   3. If CI does not pass, fix whatever is necessary and push again into the `fix_all_bugs` branch
10. Gotchas:
   1. If any of the Cargo.lock files are changed by the steps above, make sure to commit them too, else CI will punish you with inscrutable errors
   2. In some cases it may be necessary to manually [coerce Cargo.lock updates](#coerce-cargo.lock-updates)


# Tips and Tricks

## Unsorted deps {#unsorted-deps}

  If your Cargo.toml is not perfectly following dtonlay's recommendations, CI will not approve your commit. Use cargo-sort to fix that.
```sh
./cargo install cargo-sort
./cargo sort
```


## Convince a build script that your crate has correct version

   In your Cargo.toml you normally want to inherit the workspace version, which `cargo new` will default-init to

```toml
version.workspace = true
```

   But it will not work, you need


```toml
version = { workspace = true }
```

   And yes, they do the same exact thing. But the first one will fail in CI. No CI is perfect.



## Coerce Cargo.lock updates {#coerce-cargo.lock-updates}

   Sometimes Cargo.lock files can be feisty, to manually coerce Cargo.lock updates, use


```sh
./scripts/cargo-for-all-lock-files.sh tree
./scripts/cargo-for-all-lock-files.sh check --locked --tests --bins
```



## Squash the unnecessary commits{#pr-squash-commits}

1. You may want to set your `EDITOR` environment variable to the editor of choice prior to starting this.
2. `git rebase -i <commit-right-before-your-first-commit>`
3. You'll then see all of your commits from oldest to newest like this:
```
pick 109c178 Improve TPS by 20 percent
pick 0737bd6 Remove useless mutex in turbine
...
pick <commit hash X> <commit message X>
pick <commit hash Y> forgot a file
pick <commit hash Z> pleasing CI
...
pick 3f96c5c better naming for new structures
```
4. To squash the trivial commits Y and Z into X (maybe they are all related or commits Y and Z are just formatting/clippy), update the file to look like:
```
pick 109c178 Improve TPS by 20 percent
pick 0737bd6 Remove useless mutex in turbine
...
pick <commit hash X> <commit message X>
s <commit hash Y> forgot a file
s <commit hash Z> pleasing CI
...
pick 3f96c5c better naming for new structures
```
^ the `s` means you want to "squash" the commit into the commit above. Do not touch the commit message text yet, it will not do anything.
Then save the file and quit the editor to schedule squashes to git.

Next git will pop another editor window to form the commit message for the new commit X (which will now include squashed Y and Z)

* Typically, if you need to keep Y and Z commit messages in the new commit message for X, then they shouldn't be squashed.
You can thus safely comment out the commit messages Y and Z so it just will show commit message X in the final version.
* If you have squashed into several commits, you’ll have to edit several files with commit messages. Keep on modifying the commit messages as appropriate.
* Finally, the rebase will be executed. Now if you do `git log`, you will see that commits Y and Z no longer exist but are now squashed into commit X.
* It is a good idea to double check that the code is what you expect before you commit

## Crate Creation

If your PR includes a new crate, the procedure for PR is slightly different.

* Cargo new your new crate.
* Under the newly-created directory, edit Cargo.toml to look as follows:

```toml
[package]
name = "agave-useful-crate" # or solana-useful-crate
description = "Crate that does useful things"
version = { workspace = true }
authors = { workspace = true }
repository = { workspace = true }
homepage = { workspace = true }
license = { workspace = true }
edition = { workspace = true }
```
* Add a README.md explaining what your crate will do and why it is useful
* If appropriate, add the source code as well
* Submit the PR for initial review.  You should see the crate-check CI
  job fails because the newly created crate is not yet published.
* Once all review feedback has been addressed, the release team will handle the publishing
