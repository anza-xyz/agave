//! Types for directing the execution of Solana programs.
//!
//! Every invocation of a Solana program executes a single instruction, as
//! defined by the [`Instruction`] type. An instruction is primarily a vector of
//! bytes, the contents of which are program-specific, and not interpreted by
//! the Solana runtime. This allows flexibility in how programs behave, how they
//! are controlled by client software, and what data encodings they use.
//!
//! Besides the instruction data, every account a program may read or write
//! while executing a given instruction is also included in `Instruction`, as
//! [`AccountMeta`] values. The runtime uses this information to efficiently
//! schedule execution of transactions.

/// A directive for a single invocation of a Solana program.
///
/// An instruction specifies which program it is calling, which accounts it may
/// read or modify, and additional data that serves as input to the program. One
/// or more instructions are included in transactions submitted by Solana
/// clients. Instructions are also used to describe [cross-program
/// invocations][cpi].
///
/// [cpi]: https://solana.com/docs/core/cpi
///
/// During execution, a program will receive a list of account data as one of
/// its arguments, in the same order as specified during `Instruction`
/// construction.
///
/// While Solana is agnostic to the format of the instruction data, it has
/// built-in support for serialization via [`borsh`] and [`bincode`].
///
/// [`borsh`]: https://docs.rs/borsh/latest/borsh/
/// [`bincode`]: https://docs.rs/bincode/latest/bincode/
///
/// # Specifying account metadata
///
/// When constructing an [`Instruction`], a list of all accounts that may be
/// read or written during the execution of that instruction must be supplied as
/// [`AccountMeta`] values.
///
/// Any account whose data may be mutated by the program during execution must
/// be specified as writable. During execution, writing to an account that was
/// not specified as writable will cause the transaction to fail. Writing to an
/// account that is not owned by the program will cause the transaction to fail.
///
/// Any account whose lamport balance may be mutated by the program during
/// execution must be specified as writable. During execution, mutating the
/// lamports of an account that was not specified as writable will cause the
/// transaction to fail. While _subtracting_ lamports from an account not owned
/// by the program will cause the transaction to fail, _adding_ lamports to any
/// account is allowed, as long is it is mutable.
///
/// Accounts that are not read or written by the program may still be specified
/// in an `Instruction`'s account list. These will affect scheduling of program
/// execution by the runtime, but will otherwise be ignored.
///
/// When building a transaction, the Solana runtime coalesces all accounts used
/// by all instructions in that transaction, along with accounts and permissions
/// required by the runtime, into a single account list. Some accounts and
/// account permissions required by the runtime to process a transaction are
/// _not_ required to be included in an `Instruction`s account list. These
/// include:
///
/// - The program ID &mdash; it is a separate field of `Instruction`
/// - The transaction's fee-paying account &mdash; it is added during [`Message`]
///   construction. A program may still require the fee payer as part of the
///   account list if it directly references it.
///
/// [`Message`]: crate::message::Message
///
/// Programs may require signatures from some accounts, in which case they
/// should be specified as signers during `Instruction` construction. The
/// program must still validate during execution that the account is a signer.
